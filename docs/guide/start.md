# Welcome to Stack

Stack is a set of applications that I have had the need to create a custom
solution for my personal needs. This applications are also meant to help me
improve as a developer, specially in Svelte and SvelteKit. Plus, defining the
stack and the self hosting of such stack, has been a great learning experience.

::: info  
This is a personal project, which means that there may be flaws and things that
can be improved. At the same time, I try to make it as easy as possible to
understand and use, while making it as _professional_ as possible.

## Applications

Here's the list of the applications that I've built at the moment, as well as
those that I'm planning to build in the future.
